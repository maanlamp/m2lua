_Here be feature propositions._ üó∫Ô∏è

## Contribution Format
Contribution is easy and encouraged. Create an issue or pull request and provide a title and a concise feature description.

Please be as code-agnostic in writing as possible: _don't think about how to solve `X` in language `Y`_, but rather _think about how to solve `X` with (human) logic, and translate that into language `Y`_.

### Feature Title

## Description
Concise description of feature.
```

Note that concise doesn't mean _"as brief as possible"_. It means _"as complete as possible within the confines of clarity and brevity"_.
