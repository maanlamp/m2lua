# Odd Preprocessor
The preprocessor takes a stream of tokens (generated by the [lexer](../Lexer)), and finds any definitions signified by the `define` keyword. It splices these out of the array, replaces all occurences of the definition within the token stream, and returns the modified token stream to be used by the following plugins and/or stage in the processor chain.
