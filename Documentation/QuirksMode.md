# Quirks Mode
- _Planned Feature_

Compiling a program with the compiler set to Quirks Mode will enable predefined exceptions to language rules, allowing for a more natural code interaction in some cases. Do note that enabling Quirks Mode is a bit like speaking French: _for every rule there are a million exceptions._ No offense to French people.
