#### Hmm, that's odd...

# What is odd?
Odd was created with love for language, and not just for programming languages. Odd smushes together all the things I find to be best practises, grammar and syntax, while maintaining a more verbally heavy design in comparison to other languages (if it's a language, should it not flow as if you were to speak it?). Alltogether I think this makes a more easy-to-understand, easy-to-use yet very powerful language.
