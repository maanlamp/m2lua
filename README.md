# Odd Language

<div align="center">

_Hmm, that's **odd**..._

## üß† Philosophy
Odd is highly W.I.P. but these are the main goals of the language:
- Expression oriented: people don't speak in steps.
- Flowing syntax (like a language should have).
- Small footprint: should work on high- and low-end devices.
- Adopt a good few parts of functional programming into developer mindset.

<br/>
<br/>

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage
To use the Odd compiler (not finished), run it through node:
```shell
node -v
# -> v13.12.0
node --harmony ./odd/compiler.js test.odd
# -> ‚úîÔ∏è Reading file DONE (292.70 Œºs)
# -> ‚úîÔ∏è Generating lexer DONE (233.90 Œºs)
# -> ‚úîÔ∏è Parsing DONE (12.41 ms)
# -> { children: [ ... ],
#      ok: true,
#      type: "program",
#      label: null,
#      error: null }
```
Should work with some older versions of Node, but Odd is being developed with the newest versions of node to guarantee best performance and the newest javascript features.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
Odd v1.0 requires the following compiler stages to be completed:
- [x] **0.1**: [Lexical Analysis](odd/lexer.js)
- [x] **0.2**: [Parsing](odd/parser.js)
- [ ] **0.3**: Semantic Analysis
- [ ] **0.4**: Type Validation
- [ ] **0.X**: At least one working compilation/transpilation target (probably javascript first)
