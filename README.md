This repo contains a Javascript-based lexer (and will contain a parser) for a language I made myself, called "odd". It is currently in development, hence the version number being 0.

## Made with love
Odd was created with love for language, and not just for programming languages. Odd smushes together all the things I find to be best practises, grammar and nice syntax, while maintaining a more verbally heavy design in comparison to other languages (if it's a language, should it not flow as if you were to speak it?). Alltogether I think this makes a more easy-to-understand, easy-to-use yet very powerful language.

## Compiler
Odd is a compiled language, and thus goes through a couple stages before ending up as bytecode to be distributed across platforms more easily.

The aforementioned stages are:
1. Lexical Analysis
2. Preprocessing
3. Abstract Syntax Analysis
4. Optimization
5. Bytecode Generation

The reason Odd does not compile straight to Assembly Language is because that is not multi-platform and would require a full-fledged endpoint for all supported architectures. I think I'll pass on that one.

## Contribution
Feel free to contribute, I would welcome the input.
